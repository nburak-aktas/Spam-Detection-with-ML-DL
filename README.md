# Spam-Detection-with-ML-DL
A machine learning and deep learning project for detecting spam messages using NLP techniques. 


This repository contains a machine learning and deep learning project for detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Overview
- Implemented classical ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
- Implemented deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## Dataset
- Public dataset used (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data)
- Kaggle, SMS Spam Collection Dataset

## Features
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF, embeddings
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
